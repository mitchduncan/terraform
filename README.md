# terraform
My Terraform projects

This project is part of a VPC and I can push these files to Github to kickoff a
Terraform Cloud build.

the helloWorld example will do this manually also but it's not part of the VCS

This is the workspace since I tend to forget where this is:
https://app.terraform.io/app/mitchduncanaws2020/workspaces/new
