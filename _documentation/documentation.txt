Terraform Documentation

https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html


Terraform's configuration language is declarative
Terraform automatically processes resources in the correct order
A Terraform provider defines and manages a set of resource types
Most providers are associated with a particular cloud or on-premises infrastructure service

A module is a collection of .tf files kept together in a directory
The root module is built from the configuration files in the current working directory when Terraform is run
This module may reference child modules in other directories, which can in turn reference other modules, etc
The simplest Terraform configuration is a single root module containing only a single .tf files
Terraform doesn't have a concept of platform-independent resource types â€” resources are always tied to a provider
